# TDD and dependency injecion experiment

My goal when creating this project was to go beyond the tutorials and courses for learning iOS development. Usually these courses don't go too far and don't get deep enough regarding technologies used in a real world enterprise app. 

That's why this app features:

- Reactive Programming using [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and [RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxCocoa)
- Dependency Injection using [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject)
- Test driven developement using [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble)
- Being able to test my classes using fakes and mock data using [Spry](https://github.com/Rivukis/Spry)
- Make HTTP requests to an API using [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
- Manipulate the JSON response from the API using [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON)

# Demo

The app is a pokedex with a list of pokemons, if you tap a pokemon you get their details: name, sprite, moves, types and abilities
